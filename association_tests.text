Playlist table will have the max # of song adds by guest
Authorization table will have the counter of the number of songs add by guest per playlist

A user should only be able to add a song if it isn't in the playlist already?

Suggested Song
-> create, delete
Vote
-> create, delete, edit
Nest Playlist -> Suggested Song -> Vote
securerandom -> generate id that will be unique


the playlist table should store the start date/time and end date/time of playlist
Why? bc a guest cannot skip songs during the event


In first iteration the host can only delete songs.
All songs are automatically accepted.
