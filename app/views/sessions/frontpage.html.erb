    <h5>
      Q is a crowdsourcing playlist app that gives listeners a voice in what they want to hear, when they want to hear it.  The app introduces an interactive and collaborative platform that allows users to queue up and vote on songs that they want to hear, an experience undoubtedly missing from todayâ€™s music streaming industry.
